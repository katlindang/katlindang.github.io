# About this Project

Many people believe that once you reach a certin age, you can't learn things as well, like learning a language or playing an instrumment. A reason why many people believe they can't learn new things later in life is because the design and learning isn't catered to older people. The goal of this project will help promote the best user experience in electronic music learning for middle-aged men

Listening and learning music, especially electronic music, is a bonding experience that connects people throughout the world and of all ages. They are many different genres of electronic music that have been created over the years. This project aims to allow users to understand how electronic music is made and allow users to learn individual components/sounds of electronic music. 



# Design Statement 

Based on a series of research and evaluations, I decided to create 3 design features that will help users navigate and use the app more efficiently. These design features offer an easy way to look up information for individual needs as well as allow users to have freedom to learn at their own pace.

- Login Page: To allow users to save their progress and bookmark important pages

- Search Bar: Clear and easily visible search bar in the top right corner to allow users to search for specific parts of the electronic music learning website.

- Numbered Navigation Bar: Create a navigation bar at the bottom of the page to easily toggle between pages instead of clicking the back or next button multiple times
