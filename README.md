# About this Project

Many people believe that once you reach a certin age, you can't learn things as well, like learning a language or playing an instrumment. A reason why many people believe they can't learn new things later in life is because the design and learning isn't catered to older people. The goal of this project will help promote the best user experience in electronic music learning for middle-aged men

Listening and learning music, especially electronic music, is a bonding experience that connects people throughout the world and of all ages. They are many different genres of electronic music that have been created over the years. This project aims to allow users to understand how electronic music is made and allow users to learn individual components/sounds of electronic music. 



# Design Statement 

Based on a series of research and evaluations, I decided to create 3 design features that will help users navigate and use the app more efficiently. These design features offer an easy way to look up information for individual needs as well as allow users to have freedom to learn at their own pace.

- Login Page: To allow users to save their progress and bookmark important pages

- Search Bar: Clear and easily visible search bar in the top right corner to allow users to search for specific parts of the electronic music learning website.

- Numbered Navigation Bar: Create a navigation bar at the bottom of the page to easily toggle between pages instead of clicking the back or next button multiple times


# Competitor Analysis 

## Heuristic Evaluation

I conducted a heuristic evaluation on two websites: Learning Music Ableton and Attack Magazine. Both of these sites are used for electronic music learning. The purpose of a heuristic evaluation is to help identify and fix usability issues through Nielson's 10 step heuristic evaluation process.

Learning Music Ableton and Attack Magazine has some great functionality and usefulness, but the initial design for both of these sites had a high severity rating on some parts of the heuristic evaluation. The website I chose to focus on was Learning Music Ableton because I liked the fuctionality and inclusion of interactive soundboards on the site. The goal of this UX project is to cater a music learning website to middle aged men, so with this in mind, the redesign will include some key aspects as follows: 

- For Learning Music Ableton, the heuristic principles that had a high severity rating were Visibility of System Status, Match Between System and the Real World, and Help and Documentation.  
   
  - Visibility of System Status allows users to understand and know where to go as they go through the website. The problem with the website, is that it there is not a section where you can switch inbetween individual sections. If you wanted to look at a previous section, you would have to press "previous" multiple times. Including a numbered navigation bar at the bottom will allow users to easily toggle between the pages.

  - Match Between System and the Real World is the use of language and ideas that are familiar to users that flow in a natural order. There are some parts of the sections that come before explaining what to do with the interactive buttons. For example, on the beats section, it dives right into the playing with the beats before explaining what "an open hat or closed hat" means.

  - Help and Documentation provide users with additional information or help to complete the tasks. It does not include a FAQ, contact us, or help button. These are important features to add to a website or app because users can personally tell web developers the problems directly and, also, ask for help, if needed.

# Usability Testing

Unlike the heuristic evaluation, the usability testing allows researchers to identify particular problems by observing and testing the participant and recieving their feedback. Usability testing can be more helpful because it allows researchers to work directly with the target audience. For this test, I focused on 3 tasks that were based off of my heuristic evaluation. I asked the participant to search for various things within the website and evaluate how easy it was to perform these tasks. 

Here is my usability test:

As you can see, the participant was able to perform these tasks successfully and almost all with ease. Some tasks took longer to find than others, but navigating through the site was straightforward. A downside to usability testing is that participants, like mine, might not be as vocal when asking for help. It is useful as researchers to hear participants thought process, so that they could strategically place website navigation button in more clearer areas.

# User Research - Contextual Inquiry

With contextual inquiry, we are now stepping away from Learning Music Ableton, and instead, asking participants to show which websites or apps they usually use to learn music. This research method allows researchers to uncover hidden insights about users that may not be present with the other research methods we have used previously. For this research method, I used a participatory observation where I asked a series of questions pertaining to music learning. 

The parcipant chose [https://www.musictheory.net](https://www.musictheory.net) as their website of choice for music learning. This participant grew up playing music and is considered intermediate-advanced level; however, he does not know how to read sheet music. He says this website is useful to him because it is straightforward and allows him to focus on small individual chapters at a time. This contextual inquiry allowed me to see how and why this user chose this website. With this in mind, this research will help guide me to redesigning Learning Music Ableton to cater towards my target demographic.

# UX Story Telling - User Personas & Scenarios

Based on previous research and observations, I developed 2 personas for my target demographics. As stated previously, the target demographic for Learning Music Ableton are middle aged men. These personas allows researchers to understand their target users. This is an alternative way to evaluate a website compared to heuristic evaluations and interviews. The purpose of this is to gain insight about the usability and pain points of the site. Manny and Derek have different music skill levels, but they both use this site to satisfy their needs. Derek uses the fuctionality of the site for pure traditional learning; whereas, Manny uses this site mainly to use the interactive soundboards to learn how to read music notes. Although they are using different functions of the website, this website is beneficial for middle aged men of all skill levels.

# Low Fidelity Prototyping

Low Fidelity prototyping is an effective and low-cost way to test the contents of your design before the development of the final product. It allows designers to obtain user feedback to work out problem areas and errors in the design. It is low-cost and allows app designers to see how easily users can or canâ€™t navigate the app. With the heuristic evaluation and usability testing in mind, I decided to include a sign up/login page, a search bar, and a numbered navigation bar to integrate into an app. These features are included in the wireframes below. The new features allowed the particpant to easily follow and toggle between pages for an efficient learning environment.

# High-Fidelity Protype

The high-fidelity prototype is the last step after weeks of research and revision. The purpose of a high fidelity prototype is to test the fuctionality of the app as well as the interface. Through the heuristic evaluations, cognitive walkthroughs, usability tests, and accessibility tests, the high fidelity prototype incorporates everything we've learned about the target demographic to create an app that will help assist middle aged men with electronic music learning.

# Conclusion

I came in with no experience in UX/UI design, and although I struggled, this class was insightful and fun to learn about. I saw myself connecting the information I learned, to the apps I use everyday. This realization helped me get shift my mindset from being a user to being the designer/researcher. The process of UX design is long and tedious, but these steps are necessary for a user-centric design. The amount of testing, observation, and surveys allowed me to get to know the user. The first few weeks of testing and low-fidelity prototyping allowed me to design the app on functionality rather than aesthetics. After all of the intial testing and designs, then, I focused on the aesthetic.
