# About this Project

Many people believe that once you reach a certin age, you can't learn things as well, like learning a language or playing an instrumment. A reason why many people believe they can't learn new things later in life is because the design and learning isn't catered to older people. The goal of this project will help promote the best user experience in electronic music learning for middle-aged men

Listening and learning music, especially electronic music, is a bonding experience that connects people throughout the world and of all ages. They are many different genres of electronic music that have been created over the years. This project aims to allow users to understand how electronic music is made and allow users to learn individual components/sounds of electronic music. 



# Design Statement 

Based on a series of research and evaluations, I decided to create 3 design features that will help users navigate and use the app more efficiently. These design features offer an easy way to look up information for individual needs as well as allow users to have freedom to learn at their own pace.

- Login Page: To allow users to save their progress and bookmark important pages

- Search Bar: Clear and easily visible search bar in the top right corner to allow users to search for specific parts of the electronic music learning website.

- Numbered Navigation Bar: Create a navigation bar at the bottom of the page to easily toggle between pages instead of clicking the back or next button multiple times


# Competitor Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation

I conducted a heuristic evaluation on two websites: Learning Music Ableton and Attack Magazine. Both of these sites are used for electronic music learning. The purpose of a heuristic evaluation is to help identify and fix usability issues through Nielson's 10 step heuristic evaluation process.

Learning Music Ableton and Attack Magazine has some great functionality and usefulness, but the initial design for both of these sites had a high severity rating on some parts of the heuristic evaluation. The goal of this UX project is to cater a music learning website to middle aged men, so with this in mind, the redesign will include some key aspects as follows: 

- For Learning Music Ableton, the heuristic principles that had a high severity rating were Visibility of System Status, Match Between System and the Real World, and Help and Documentation.  
   
 - Visibility of System Status allows users to understand and know where to go as they go through the website. The problem with the website, is that it
